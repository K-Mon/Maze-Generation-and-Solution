# Maze-Generation-and-Solution

The files will generate a maze and then solve it.

1) The maze is generated using backtracking. The steps
were generated using the pseudo code on wikipedia.

2) There are two methods of solving the maze:
  - The first being a breadth first algorithm
  - The second being Djikstras Algorithm.

The nodes for djikstra were generated by finding 
all the intersections on the maze. 

A potentialk method of speeding up the solutions 
would be to incorporate numpy arrays.

The final output will be an image that will show the path.
